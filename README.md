[SageOne API](https://accounting.sageone.co.za/api/1.1.2/Help) client for PHP

This is a 100% fully unit tested and (mostly) fully featured unofficial PHP
client for SageOne

> "Simple Online Accounting & Payroll software"

```bash
composer require darrynten/sage-one-php
```

PHP 7.0+

## Basic use

# TODO

### Definitions

# TODO

## Features

This is the basic outline of the project and is a work in progress.

Checkboxes have been placed at each section, please check them off
in this readme when submitting a pull request for the features you
have covered.

### Basic ORM-style mapping

Related models are auto-loaded and are all queryable, mutable, and persistable where possible.

I'm sure there will be a recursion issue because of this at some point!

Some examples

```php
$account = new Account($config);

// get
$account->all(); // fetches ALL
$account->get($id); // fetches that ID

// related models
echo $account->category->id;

// dates
echo $account->defaultTaxType->modified->format('Y-m-d');

// assign
$account->name = 'New Name';

// save, delete
$account->save(); // incomplete
$account->category->save(); // saving a child does not save the parent and vice-versa
$account->delete();
```

### Application base

* Guzzle is used for the communications (I think we should replace?)
* The library has 100% test coverage
* The library supports framework-agnostic caching so you don't have to
worry about which framework your package that uses this package is going
to end up in.

The client is not 100% complete and is a work in progress, details below.

## Documentation

There are over 100 API endpoints, initial focus is only on a handful of these

This will eventually fully mimic the documentation available on the site.
https://accounting.sageone.co.za/api/1.1.2

Each section must have a short explaination and some example code like on
the API docs page.

Checked off bits are complete.

# Note

The API calls are mostly _very_ generic, so there is a base model in place that
all other models extend off, which covers the following functionalities:

- GET Model/Get
- GET Model/Get/{id}
- DELETE Model/Delete/{id}
- POST Model/Save ** Incomplete **

This means that it's trivial to add new models that only use these calls (or a
combination of any of them) as there is a very simple 'recipe' to constructing
a basic model.

As such we only need to focus on the tricky bits.

# NB the project is evolving quickly

## This might be outdared

### If it is and you fix it please update this document

#### The best place to look is the example model

### Basic model template

[Account Example Docs](https://accounting.sageone.co.za/api/1.1.2/Help/ResourceModel?modelName=Account)

There's a table at that link that looks something like this

```
Name             | Type             | Additional Information
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Name             | string           | None.
Category         | AccountCategory  | None.
Balance          | decimal          | Read Only / System Generated
ReportingGroupId | nullable integer | None.
```

We'll be using that for this example (docblocks excluded from example but are
required)

```php
/**
 * The name of the class is the `modelName=` value from the URL
 */
class Account extends BaseModel

    // The name of the endpoint (same as filename), protected
    protected $endpoint = 'Account';

    /**
     * Field definitions
     * 
     * Used by the base class to decide what gets submitted in a save call,
     * validation, etc
     *
     * All must include a type, whether or not it's nullable, and whether or
     * not it's readonly, or default, required, min, max, or regex
     *
     * - nullable is `true` if the word 'nullable' is in the 'type' column
     * - readonly is `true` if the word 'Read-Only/System Generated' is in the Additional Info column otherwise it is `false`
     * - Type has the following rules
     *   - `date` becomes "DateTime"
     *   - `nullable` is removed, i.e. "nullable integer" is only "integer"
     *   - Multiword linked terms are concatenated, eg:
     *     - "Account Category" becomes "AccountCategory"
     *     - "Tax Type" becomes "TaxType"
     *   - `min` / `max` always come together
     *   - `default` is when it's indicated in the docs
     *   - `regex` is generally used with email address fields
     *
     * Details on writable properties for Account:
     * https://accounting.sageone.co.za/api/1.1.2/Help/ResourceModel?modelName=Account
     * @var array $fields
     */
    protected $fields = [
        'id' => [
            'type' => 'integer',
            'nullable' => false,
            'readonly' => true,
        ],
        'name' => [
            'type' => 'string',
            'nullable' => false,
            'readonly' => false,
            'required' => true,
        ],
        'category' => [
            'type' => 'AccountCategory',
            'nullable' => false,
            'readonly' => false,
            'min' => 0,
            'max' => 100,
        ],
        'reportingGroupId' => [
            'type' => 'integer',
            'nullable' => true,
            'readonly' => false,
            'regex' => '/someregex/',
        ],
        'isTaxLocked' => [
            'type' => 'boolean',
            'nullable' => false,
            'readonly' => true,
        ],
        // etc etc etc
    ];

    /**
     * Features supported by the endpoint
     *
     * These features enable and disable the CRUD calls based on what is
     * supported by the SageOne API
     *
     * Most models use at least one of these features, with a fair amount
     * using all the functionality.
     *
     * @var array $features
     */
    protected $features = [
        'all' => true,
        'get' => true,
        'save' => true,
        'delete' => true,
    ];

    // Construct (if you need to modify construction)
    public function __construct(array $config)
    {
        parent::__construct($config);
    }

    // Add methods for non-standard calls, like:
    // GET Account/GetAccountsByCategoryId/{id}
    public function getAccountsByCategoryId($id)
    {
        // etc ...
    }
}
```

Following that template will very quickly create models for the project.

There is *also* an example test (ExampleModelTest.php) and an example mock
folder to help you get going quickly.

A lot of the heavy testing is handled by the BaseModelTest class, and you
can look into the Example test for insight into the convention. It makes
testing and getting good defensive coverage quite trivial for most things.

# ==== END OF INITIAL DELIVERY ====

## Deliverables

* 100% Test Coverage
* Full, extensive, verbose, and defensive unit tests
* Mocks if there are none for the model in the `tests/mocks` directory (convention
can be inferred from the existing names in the folders)

## Caching

### Request Limits

All Sage One companies have a request limit of 5000 API requests per day. A maximum of 100 results will be returned for list methods, regardless of the parameter sent through.

[Details](https://www.sageone.co.za/request-limit-faq/)

Because of this some of them can
benefit from being cached. All caching should be off by default and only
used if explicity set.

No caching has been implemented yet but support is in place

### Details

These run through the `darrynten/any-cache` package, and no extra config
is needed. Please ensure that any features that include caching have it
be optional and initially set to `false` to avoid unexpected behaviour.

### Rate Limiting and Queueing

# TODO

## Contributing and Testing

There is currently 100% test coverage in the project, please ensure that
when contributing you update the tests. For more info see CONTRIBUTING.md

We would love help getting decent documentation going, please get in touch
if you have any ideas.
