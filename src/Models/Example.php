     * Defines all possible fields.
     *
     * This maps to all the public properties you added above
     *
     * Used by the base class to decide what gets submitted in a save call,
     * validation, etc
     *
     * All must include a type, whether or not it's nullable, and whether or
     * not it's persistable.
     *
     * Documentation -> Model Conversion Rules:
     *
     * - Nullable is `true` if the word 'nullable' is in the 'type' column
     * - Persistable is `true` if the word 'None.' is in the Additional Info column.
     * - Type has the following rules
     *   - `date` becomes "DateTime"
     *   - `nullable` is removed, i.e. "nullable integer" is only "integer"
     *   - Multiword linked terms are concatenated, eg:
     *     - "Example Category" becomes "ExampleCategory"
     *     - "Example Type" becomes "ExampleType"
     *
     * NB: Naming convention for keys is to lowercase the first character of the
     * field returned by Sage (they use PascalCase and we use camelCase)
     *
     * `ID` is automatically converted to and from `id`
     *
     * Include a link with Details on writable properties for Example:
     * https://accounting.sageone.co.za/api/1.1.2/Help/ResourceModel?modelName=Example
